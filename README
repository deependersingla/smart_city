Problem: Traffic is a huge problem in today metro cities and It will continue to increase as more people will move towards middle class and they will buy automobiles (which is a good thing :). As I want to see a world where everyone has only first world problems nothing else. Traffic is a huge problem because of which people waste their time, fuel which also harm environment. 

Solution: I think by using all the data available to us for traffic, we can solve this issue by predicting traffic behaviour so roads usage can be optimized.

Lets start hacking.

Sources of data:

Language used:
Python (just starting with it, I am a ruby programmer BTW :) )

Steps:
1) Check you have python and sqlite 3 installed. Easy way to check: python, sqlite3.version
