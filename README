Problem: 1Traffic is a huge problem in today metor cities and It will continue to increase as more people will move towards middle class and they will buy automobiles (which is a good thindg :). 
As I want to see a world where everyone has only first world problems nothing else. But to make this dream come true we need to solve the problem with traffic.

Traffic is definately a first world problem. Its a huge problem because of which people waste their time, fuel which also harm environment. 

Solution: I think if we can all the data available to us for traffic, we can solve this issue by predicting traffic behaviour so roads usage can be optimized.

Lets start hacking.
